# STATE

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Produce a continuously updatable, auditable investment view where factor-level claims, panel verdicts, and memo deltas remain structured and reusable across reruns.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 scaffold completion for the remaining top-level panels

## Execution Tracking

**Current Phase:** 3
**Current Phase Name:** Remaining Panel Scaffolds
**Total Phases:** 5
**Current Plan:** 1
**Total Plans in Phase:** 4
**Status:** Phase 3 in progress — scaffold registry slice complete
**Progress:** [████████░░] 77%
**Last Activity:** 2026-03-12
**Last Activity Description:** Completed Phase 3 Plan 01 scaffold registry coverage with Docker-verified registry tests

## Current Status

- Phase 1 completed on 2026-03-10 with passing lint, tests, and Docker operator smoke validation.
- Core config, persistence, interface, provider/tool, and orchestration contracts are now in place.
- Phase 2 Plan 01 completed on 2026-03-11 with passing Docker-based tests and lint for the checkpoint runtime slice.
- Phase 2 completed on 2026-03-11 with repaired first-completion baseline semantics, deterministic ACME artifacts, and Docker-verified lint/test/example generation passes.
- Phase 3 Plan 01 completed on 2026-03-12 with normalized disabled placeholder leads, explicit scaffold panel factor mappings, and passing registry verification.
- All remaining top-level panels now have config-backed scaffold topology with matching placeholder prompt paths and non-empty owned factor mappings.
- The first production panels remain `gatekeepers` and `demand_revenue_quality`, while the remaining panels stay visible in config but non-runnable.

## Key Risks

- Local host Python is 3.9.6 while the target runtime must be Python 3.11+ for modern LangGraph support.
- Broad domain scope could tempt bespoke orchestration unless config and subgraph boundaries stay disciplined.
- Sample adapters must stay representative without drifting into speculative connector complexity.

## Next Step

- Execute Phase 3 Plan 02 to replace generic scaffold factor descriptions and placeholder prompt bodies against the now-complete registry surface.

## Decisions

- [Phase 02]: Persist awaiting_continue, provisional, gate_decision, and checkpoint_panel_id as typed run fields instead of inferring lifecycle from metadata blobs.
- [Phase 02]: Let LangGraph own the gatekeeper pause/resume path through interrupt() and Command(resume=...) using run_id as the durable thread identity.
- [Phase 02]: Keep analyze_company, refresh_company, and run_panel as public entrypoints, but force downstream panel work to resume existing checkpointed runs instead of bypassing gatekeepers.
- [Phase 02]: Keep checkpointed and completed memo projection in one service pipeline, and express posture through section status plus operator-facing content.
- [Phase 02]: Classify rerun deltas from structured claim, verdict, and memo posture changes while always refreshing the what_changed_since_last_run run log.
- [Phase 02]: Expose tool log provenance as returned evidence, claim, and memo section ids, and mirror stale-evidence semantics in the fake provider for deterministic tests.
- [Phase 02]: Generate ACME artifacts through the same AnalysisService entrypoints the app exposes, not a parallel sample runtime.
- [Phase 02]: Enforce reproducibility by driving IDs and timestamps through patchable shared clock/id seams, then lock checked-in files to generator output.
- [Phase 02]: Verify the plan in Docker because the host machine still defaults to Python 3.9 while the repo targets Python 3.11+.
- [Phase 02]: Treat explicit null and empty baseline metadata as intentional no-baseline state during resume.
- [Phase 02]: Recover legacy paused-run baselines from the latest non-current memo, claim, and verdict history instead of the paused run's promoted active state.
- [Phase 02]: Keep same-run placeholder memo sections not_advanced on first completion and reserve stale carry-forward for true reruns.
- [Phase 03]: Make scaffold factor ownership explicit through panel.factor_ids rather than relying on implicit grouping in factors.yaml.
- [Phase 03]: Normalize scaffold-only panels around one disabled lead placeholder instead of adding deeper agent trees in Phase 3.
- [Phase 03]: Leave parent requirement V2-01 open because Plan 03-01 delivers only prerequisite slice V2-01A.
